          <p>A year of Game/Level Design during which I worked with a dozen of others students to create a game within 3 months.

We've made a public presentation during the Gamarora Gameshow.</p>

          <h3>Dinosaurus and Indie Game developments (almost)</h3>
          <p>I worked with a friend on a game project for about 8 months, called Dinosaurus. We showed our dev build during an event called Indie Game Lab that took place in the HARU Japan touch of 2016. Alas, we didn't complete development and the project was dropped.<br>After that, I made a few game projects by myself, although, without any skills in programmation at the time, I wasn't able to do much.</p>

                Dinosaurus was a project I made with a friend, on Unity 3D. I was in charge of Art style and Game Design. The game was a RTS (Real Time Strategy) game set in a prehistoric era where dinosaurs walked together with humans, much like in the Flintstones.
                Five clans were playable in the game, each having different victory conditions. For one clan, the condition for victory was total annihilation of the others groups; for another, having enough money to build a statue of them; and for the last clan, they needed to have more than 80% of the NPC under their command. The game was an inspiration of Warcraft for the gameplay, and Don't Starve for the art style. It went under due to poor time and money managment, and lack of motivation from both parts.

                20 000 Lieues Sans La Mer (20.000 Leagues Witout The Sea) was a student project made by twenty students including myself, created during the course of Level/Game Designer run by Gamagora. The player embodied the mighty god of the Sea Poseidon/also a sea sponge, tasked to understand why the sea disappeared over night, and bring back the order under the sea. Made within three months, the game was a 9 levels short game, representing a third of the game had it been produced fully. I was in charge of a bit of Game design and Art design. Although it was hard to work as a team sometimes, it was a great opportunity to show what we were capable of.

                Sleipnir is a project I developped by myself for about 6 months. I didn't have any skills in programmation yet so I learned C# for this project, which was not completed due to financial reasons. It was a 2D platformer/action like Megaman X, in which you play as a cyborg who can jump, shoot, cut with his sword, dash, wall-jump... The player has a wide range of movements available at any time. This game had different levels with multiple ways to get to the boss, and even some secret bosses and a alternate ending. It was a far too big project to work by myself. I only have a prototype of player movement, before the implementation of dash mechanics. But the game design still exists, just in case I can finally finish it someday.

                This is a concept for a point-and-click game, with a "film noir" atmosphere. This is an adaptation of a movie animation I had made a long time ago. This game retains the art style and storyline of the movie. The player is offered a modular story, through their errors and deductions. The player can make their own stories and can arrest almost any NPC at the end of the game.
